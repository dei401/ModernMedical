This is a test.
Prior to any phone screens, we do kind of a little "precursor" or "Step 0" to our interviewing process.   Please have David follow the instructions below and then email Jey Donovan at jdonovan@modernmedical.com, the link to their github account so that he can pull the code and examine it.
 
1. Create a Free GitHub account (if candidate does not already have one).  There is a VERY easy walkthrough available at http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/
2. Create a C# Console Application
  a. Have the program go through the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive)
  b. If the number is divisible by 3 only, output Modern
  c. If the number is divisible by 5 only, output Medical
  d. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, output ModernMedical
  e. If the number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, only output the number itself.
  f. The correct output for the first 20 of the 100 numbers should look like:
 
  1
  2
  Modern
  4
  Medical
  Modern
  7
  8
  Modern
  Medical
  11
  Modern
  13
  14
  ModernMedical
  16
  17
  Modern
  19
  Medical
 
3. Push the C# console application with the candidate's answer to that problem into their remote GitHub repository.
4. Push the candidate's resume into their same GitHub repository (a separate push from the project push).
5. Send us a link to the repository so that we can examine the code.
6. If this goes well, we will consider a phone interview as the next step.
 
Please remember that time to complete this task is important, as well as the quality of the code that they write.  Jey will make a decision very quickly after receiving the link to the repository on moving forward with a phone interview or not.
 
Thanks
 
Kelly



Thank you Jey for the second opportunity.
